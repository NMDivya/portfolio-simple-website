**Features**
Two-page site with clear navigation between Home and Contact
Clean, simple layout suitable for a first portfolio
Responsive design that adapts to different browsers
Organized code with comments for readability
Basic typography and color styling

**Prerequisites**

Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., portfolio-website-two-pages).
Clone the repo:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website-two-pages.git
Open the project in your code editor and run directly from the file system. No server is required for basic HTML/CSS, but you can use a simple local server if you prefer.

Edit the content in index.html, contact.html, and styles.css to customize your information, projects, and styling.

bash

Replace placeholder text with your bio, project highlights, and contact details.
On the Home page, add a visible link to the Contact page (and vice versa if desired).
Customize colors, typography, and spacing in styles.css.
